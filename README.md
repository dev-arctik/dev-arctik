# Hey, I'm Devansh Raj

**AI Agent Developer** | Vadodara, India

I build AI agents and explore the intersection of large language models with real-world automation. Currently deep into LangChain, LangGraph, and agent frameworks — turning LLMs into tools that actually do things.

---

### What I'm working on

- Building autonomous AI agents with **LangGraph** and **LangChain**
- Exploring agent frameworks like **Agno** for rapid prototyping
- Learning foundational ML — neural networks from scratch, backprop, the whole stack
- Experimenting with **AI-powered automation** using natural language
